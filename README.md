# Walmart Data Engineering Project
Data analysis and forecasting project using Walmart sales data to uncover operational insights in sales, inventory, and demand patterns.

## Project Overview
This project applies data engineering and analysis techniques to Walmart's public sales dataset. The goal is to explore trends in sales, holidays, and economic factors while building pipelines for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data. Beyond analysis, the project demonstrates how data engineering practices can structure raw data into usable insights for forecasting, inventory management, and staffing decisions.

## Key Objectives
- Ingest and organize Walmart sales data
- Clean and preprocess large datasets efficiently
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sales and external factors
- Build forecasting models for weekly sales
- Develop reproducible data pipelines using Python

## Tools & Skills
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploration
- **Data Engineering Concepts** (pipelines, cleaning, transforming)
- **Git/GitHub**

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Walmart Sales Forecasting dataset**, which includes:
- Store and Department IDs
- Weekly sales data
- Holiday indicators
- Economic factors: Temperature, Fuel Price, CPI, Unemployment
